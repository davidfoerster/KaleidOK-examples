 - Try to move back to Minim library. Can the audio processor work simultaneously with the speech-to-text library on the audio input? (easy)

 - noise filter; figure out how to get rid of intense low frequencies

 - Detect pitch and act upon it (see issues below) (easy)

 - asynchronous synesthetiation and image downloads

 - figure out how to display images ((re-)placement, transition)

 - choose and use feature from Tarsos or minim audio for foobar layer

 - mock Chromatik client (optional)

TarsosDSP:
 - enable overlapping FFT windows (trivial)
 - implement volume level detection (easy)
 - logarithmic averaging of Fourier amplitudes (medium)
 - put pitch detector into audio processing chain (easy)

Minim:
 - implement overlapping FFT windows (medium)
 - implement pitch detection algorithm (hard)

STT:
 - Re-implement STT to use Java audio framework instead of Minim. While at it, improve the library architecture (threading and stuff). (medium)

Sphinx:
 - get it to work properly
 - find out, how to relate single words to recording sections
