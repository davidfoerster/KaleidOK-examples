# Kaleidoscope

## Setup

 1. Flickr API key:

    [Request a Flickr API key](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/)
    and store it in `data/api-key.flickr.txt`. The 1st line must contain the
    public API key, the 2nd must contain the shared secret for that key.
    Example:

        e0b92403f258c35c6b43d2e21c640f9f
        bd7a0f0bcc5dfc25

 2. Some libraries need to be set up, but I'm not going into that now.


## Usage

 1. Run KaleidoscopeApp as Java applet.

 2. Below the sketch canvas are two text fields. The upper one is for a message
    to synesthetise, the lower one for search terms for Chromatik's image
    search.

 3. You can run perform a synesthetiation and image search by having the upper
    text field in focus and pressing ENTER.
